# My personal main page based on Minimal Theme

[Demo the original Theme](http://orderedlist.github.com/minimal/)

[Theme Author](https://github.com/orderedlist)

I customize it for my daily use of my personal main page:

* You can specify the content of two languages by just editing the content.md(English) and content_zh-cn.md(Chinese), and the ajax request will automatically render the content to your website

* The website will, based on your browser default language, render the content in content.md or content_zh-cn.md, or you can manually click the language icon to change the language
